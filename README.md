# Duplicate_Invoice_Automation
This script automates the process of managing invoice PDFs, extracting text, identifying duplicates, and organizing the data into specific folders, with detailed logging and error handling. The pandas DataFrames at the end allow for an easy review of the unique and duplicate invoices processed during the run.
